# Trusted Voices - Development Status

## Current Development Status

### Frontend (Priority)
- ✅ Basic UI structure with form inputs
  - LinkedIn URL input with paste support
  - Job title input with comma-separated support
  - Company size selection via checkboxes
  - Results table layout
  - CSV export functionality
- ✅ Material-UI integration
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ❌ API integration testing needed
- ❌ Performance optimization needed

### Backend (Optional - Included for Reference)
- ✅ Basic Express.js server setup
- ✅ The Swarm API client structure
- ✅ Error handling framework
- ❌ API endpoint verification needed
- ❌ Rate limiting implementation needed

### Known Issues

1. The Swarm API Integration:
   - Current endpoint structure (`/profiles/{profileId}/network`) returns 404
   - Need to verify correct API endpoints and authentication method
   - Need to confirm API access permissions

2. Environment Setup:
   - API key and URL configuration needed
   - Need to verify API rate limits and quotas

## Next Steps

### Frontend Priority
1. Complete API integration
   - Verify API endpoints with The Swarm support
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states and error messages
   - Test with real API responses

2. Performance Optimization
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add request caching
   - Optimize re-renders

3. Testing
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add end-to-end testing

### Backend (Optional)
1. API Integration
   - Verify endpoints with The Swarm support
   - Test authentication method
   - Implement rate limiting

2. Error Handling
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement retry logic
   - Add request validation

## Questions for The Swarm Support

1. API Endpoints:
   - What is the correct endpoint structure for network connections?
   - Are there any specific API version requirements?
   - What are the rate limits and quotas?

2. Authentication:
   - What is the correct authentication method?
   - Are there any specific header requirements?
   - How should we handle token refresh?

3. Data Access:
   - What permissions are needed for network access?
   - Are there any specific profile ID requirements?
   - What is the expected response format?
